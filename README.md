### What is this game about?
> In this game, you can "gamble" with virtual money, with the goal of being at the very top. You can choose to either select a certain amount of money to gamble, or gamble it all. When you gamble, you have a change to multiply it by 2x, or multiply it down by 2x

### When will there be updates?
> Whenever I feel like it, I'm just working on this game for fun, so updates will probably be either bi-weekly or monthly. As to when I will be adding a money saving feature, I do not know. Maybe like a weekish or two. I'm currently busy with school, so it might take a while for me to find some free time.

### How can I make suggestions?
> There are two main ways that you can submit suggestions. Either through my email, or through my Discord account. Before you make a suggestion, make sure that you follow these guidelines:

1. Make sure that it is feasible, and not to ambitious
2. Make sure that your suggestion is detailed enough to get your idea across
3. Don't make joke suggestions. I don't want to waste time by reading through stuff like "Make it real money," So don't do that
4. Anything NSFW, or real life related will be automatically declined, so don't even try
