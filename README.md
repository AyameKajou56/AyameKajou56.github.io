### What is this game about?
> In this game, you can "gamble" with virtual money, with the goal of being at the very top. You can choose to either select a certain amount of money to gamble, or gamble it all. When you gamble, you have a change to multiply it by 2x, or multiply it down by 2x

### When will there be updates?
> Whenever I feel like it, I'm just working on this game for fun, so updates will probably be either bi-weekly or monthly. As to when I will be adding a money saving feature, I do not know. Maybe like a weekish or two. I'm currently busy with school, so it might take a while for me to find some free time.

### Warnings:
- This is all **FAKE** and is with virtual currency. I, AyameKajou56, the creator, am not responsible for anything that happens to the people who play this game.
- Progress does not save, soon it will though. Feel free to suggest stuff through email! ("jojoslover42@gmail.com")
